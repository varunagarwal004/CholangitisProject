# CholangitisProject
Developed a multivariate regression model in R to predict whether a patient has a case of cholangitis based on an extensive dataset of clinical trials.
Answered the question of whether the drug D-penicillamine had an effect on the number of days a patient survived using the results from my model.
Utilized data science techniques for data cleaning, data processing, visualizations, modeling, variable selection/manipulation, and cross validation.
